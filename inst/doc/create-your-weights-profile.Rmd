## Create your own weights profile.

The `risk.assessr` package has a default weighting profile which assigns a weighting profile of 1 to each riskmetric
giving equal weighting to each risk metric.

If you wish to create your own weighting profile, 

1 - go to the R script 
`create_weights_profile()` in the `R` folder.

2 - Open the script and you will see the following code:

```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(risk.assessr)

create_weights_profile <- function() {
  weights <- c(
    has_bug_reports_url = .2,
    license = .1,
    has_examples = .4,
    has_maintainer = .2,
    has_news = .2,
    size_codebase = .2,
    has_source_control = .1,
    has_vignettes = .4,
    has_website = .4,
    news_current = .2,
    export_help = .2,
    export_calc = .2,
    check = .75,
    covr = .6,
    dep_score = .5,
    revdep_score = .1
  )
  return(weights)
}
```

3 - set your own weights for each risk metric

4 - save the file

5 - Go to the `Build` Tab

6 - Click the `More` Tab

7 - Click `Document`, `Clean and Install`, and `Load All` 

8 - Run the riskmetric functions `assess_pkg()` or `assess_pkg_r_package()` to
    calculate riskmetrics using your weights profile.
